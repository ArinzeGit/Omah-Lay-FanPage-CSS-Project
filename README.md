# Omah Lay Fanpage CSS Project
## Context and Description
This project was the final task of the "HTML5 and CSS Fundamentals" edX course. I was tasked with building a celebrity fanpage for my favourite artiste using the basic HTML elements I learned and CSS for styling.
## How to run
* Ensure you have a modern web browser installed
* Open the index.html file in your web browser
* The project should now be visible in your browser
## Technologies used
* HTML
* CSS
## Challenges faced during development
* Setting height and width of media elements distorted them
  * I discovered the value 'auto' for width and height properties that maintained the intrinsic aspect ratios of media
